# Surfs Up

## Overview

W. Avy is considering investing in a surf and ice cream shop in Oahu.  In order to go to the Board of Directors about investing in this new business venture he needs some analysis done on the weather in Oahu.  To complete this analysis we will be using SQLite databases.  W. Avy wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results

1. The average temperature in Oahu in June is 74 degrees and December is 71 degrees.  There is a 3 degree difference in temperature between these months which is a small variance.
2. The maximum temperature in Oahu in June is 85 degrees and December is 83 degrees.  There is a small variance of 2 degrees in temperature between these months.
3. The minimum temperature in Oahu in June is 64 degrees and December is 56 degrees.  The variance between these months is larger at 12 degrees.

## Summary

Based on this analysis the weather is fairly similar and could be great for a year round surf and ice cream shop.  With the minimum weather being significantly colder in December it might be a good idea to consider offering other food items during that time of year.  It would be beneficial to find out how many days there are in each month at the minimum temperature as well as what the temperatures are in other cities in Hawaii.  This will help determine if Oahu is the best location for the first surf and ice cream shop.
